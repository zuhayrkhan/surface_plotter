# Surface Plotter

This app is static content once built, so you can open it locally without hosting it anywhere. Run a one-time build and then open `dist/index.html` directly in your browser.

## UI Preview

GitHub README files do not render live HTML/JS embeds (like iframes or scripts). The only options that render in GitHub are static images or links.

- Open the app locally: build the project and open `dist/index.html`.
- Or open the source HTML directly from the repo: [`index.html`](index.html).

## Build for static use

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Open `dist/index.html` in your browser.
